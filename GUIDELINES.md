<p><strong><em>How to translate an academic CV into an industry resume<br>that survives ATS and lands interviews at big tech.</em></strong></p>

______________________________________________________________________

## :x: The Core Problem

Academic CVs and industry resumes serve fundamentally different audiences.

| | Academic CV | Industry Resume |
|---|---|---|
| **Reader** | Faculty committee | ATS parser → recruiter → hiring manager |
| **Goal** | Demonstrate research depth | Demonstrate engineering impact |
| **Length** | As long as needed | 1 page |
| **Focus** | Venue, novelty, contribution | Problem → system → result |
| **Tone** | "We propose…" | "Built / Designed / Deployed…" |

______________________________________________________________________

## :warning: ATS Survival First

Big tech companies (Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Zoox, etc.) route every resume through an Applicant Tracking System **before** a human sees it. Many academic resumes fail here invisibly.

**Common ATS failure points in academic LaTeX CVs:**

- Custom fonts (`XeLaTeX`, `fontspec`) → garbled or empty output
- Multi-column layouts → columns merged or dropped
- Fancy glyphs and Unicode symbols → replaced with `?` or skipped
- Tables for contact info or publication lists → content silently lost
- Colored `hyperref` boxes → sometimes flagged as formatting errors

**Safe choices:** `pdflatex`, single-column layout, standard fonts, minimal special characters.
Use `jakes-format/` if you are unsure — it is specifically designed to pass these filters.

## :building_construction: Recommended Resume Structure

### (1) Header + 1-Line Summary

Lead with a tight positioning statement packed with domain keywords.

```
Robotics researcher specializing in real-time 3D perception, large-scale SLAM,
and production-grade mapping systems (MIT, KAIST).
```

Keywords to include: `SLAM`, `mapping`, `perception`, `autonomy`, `LiDAR`, `real-time`, `large-scale`, `sensor fusion`.

### (2) Experience — The Most Important Section

Each bullet must follow: **[What problem] + [What you built] + [Impact / scale]**

| | Example |
|---|---|
| ❌ Bad | "Worked on SLAM system" |
| ❌ Bad | "Published 10+ papers on LiDAR odometry" |
| ✅ Good | "Built a large-scale LiDAR-inertial SLAM system enabling real-time mapping in airport-scale environments" |
| ✅ Good | "Developed a degeneracy-aware odometry pipeline reducing localization failures in geometrically sparse environments (corridors, open spaces)" |

**Power words for robotics / AV roles:**
`real-time` · `large-scale` · `robust` · `deployed` · `production` · `system` · `pipeline` · `scalable` · `low-latency`

### (3) Projects — Show, Don't Just Tell

Open-source projects with GitHub stars are concrete proof of engineering ability and community adoption.
Lead with the GitHub badge, then one line describing the system and its real-world relevance.

```
KISS-Matcher [★ 643]  —  Point Cloud Registration  |  IEEE ICRA 2025
Real-time, robust 3D registration pipeline; backbone for multi-session LiDAR SLAM systems.
```

### (4) Publications — Signal, Not List

For industry, publications are a credibility signal, not the main event.

**Aggressive (big tech):**
```
10+ first-author papers at IEEE ICRA, RSS, IEEE RA-L, NeurIPS, ICCV, IJRR
```

**Conservative:** List 2–3 most impactful with a brief system description. Do not list all papers — recruiters do not read them.

## :pencil: Paper → Bullet Conversion Formula

| Before (academic) | After (industry) |
|---|---|
| "We propose a novel degeneracy-aware LiDAR-inertial odometry method" | "Developed a robust LiDAR-inertial SLAM system that maintains stable localization in geometrically sparse environments" |
| "Our method achieves state-of-the-art on benchmark X" | "Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on X with 10× speedup over prior methods" |
| "Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach" | "Deployed and validated in real-world environments; adopted by 640+ robotics teams (GitHub stars)" |

**Rules:**
- **Delete:** `novel`, `we propose`, `we present`, `we show`, `experiments demonstrate`
- **Replace with:** `built`, `designed`, `deployed`, `developed`, `engineered`
- **Add scale:** GitHub stars, team size, environment scale, latency numbers, dataset size

______________________________________________________________________

## :mag: Big Tech ATS Keywords — Robotics / AV Focus

**Must include (if applicable):**
```
real-time  ·  large-scale  ·  robust  ·  production  ·  deployed  ·  system  ·  pipeline
```

**Include if applicable:**
```
distributed  ·  scalable  ·  optimization  ·  low-latency  ·  sensor fusion  ·  autonomous  ·  perception
```

## :robot: For SLAM Researchers Specifically

SLAM research translates extremely well to AV industry — if framed correctly.

| Academic framing | Industry framing |
|---|---|
| "Point cloud registration" | "3D sensor data alignment pipeline for real-time map building" |
| "Ground segmentation" | "Real-time drivable surface detection for AV perception stack" |
| "Dynamic object removal" | "Static map maintenance system for long-term autonomous operation" |
| "Multi-session SLAM" | "Incremental, large-scale 3D mapping across multiple robot deployments" |
| "Degeneracy-aware odometry" | "Fault-tolerant localization robust to sensor-degenerate environments" |

Your open-source repos (ERASOR, Patchwork++, KISS-Matcher, etc.) already have hundreds of stars — lead with them. They signal that your code is production-quality and widely adopted, which is exactly what big tech hiring managers want to see.

## :x: Common Mistakes

1. **Listing papers instead of systems** — recruiters do not read citations
2. **"We propose / we present"** — academic tone; replace with first-person active verbs
3. **Math-heavy descriptions** — no one in the industry hiring loop cares about the SL(4) manifold (even if your paper is about it); describe what the *system does*
4. **No numbers** — if you cannot quantify, describe scale: `city-scale`, `airport-scale`, `1000+ hours of data`
5. **Contribution unclear** — every bullet must answer: *"so what does this mean for the robot or product?"*
6. **Multi-column LaTeX CV submitted directly** — run it through an ATS simulator first, or just use `jakes-format/`
