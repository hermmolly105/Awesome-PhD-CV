Hey! I'm [Hyungtae Lim](https://limhyungtae.github.io/hyungtae-lim/), a robotics researcher who achived my Ph.D at [KAIST](https://urobot.kaist.ac.kr/) in South Korea, and recently wrapped up a postdoc at MIT, and just landed a job at a big tech company.

While preparing my industry applications, I quickly realized there's a huge discrepancy between what a big tech company needs and what academia expects. An academic CV is long, publication-heavy, and formatted for a human reviewer who cares about your research story. An industry resume needs to survive an ATS filter first — and a lot of the LaTeX tricks we use in academic CVs (custom fonts, multi-column layouts, fancy glyphs) silently break those parsers before a recruiter ever sees your name.

This repo collects the templates I used and adapted, organized by use case, so you don't have to figure that out the hard way.

## :thinking: Which Template Should I Use?

> **Targeting industry (including big tech)?** Use `jakes-format/` first. Big tech companies (Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, etc.) route resumes through applicant tracking system (ATS) before a human ever reads them.
> Jake's format is plain pdfLaTeX with no custom fonts, no multi-column layout, and no special glyphs — all of which are common ATS failure points.
> If you prefer a denser, two-column layout and are confident the company accepts it, `deedy-format/` is a strong alternative.
>
> **Applying for a PhD program or academic position?** Use `research-cv/` — it supports multi-page layouts, full publication lists, and the detailed academic history that faculty committees expect.

| Template | Best For | Pages | Columns | Engine |

| **Awesome-CV** | Faculty/postdoc applications, academic CV | Multi-page | 1 | XeLaTeX |
| **Jake's** | Industry SWE/internship applications | 1 | 1 | pdfLaTeX |
| **Deedy** | Experienced tech professionals | 1 | 2 | XeLaTeX |
